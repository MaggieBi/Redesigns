        <ol>
            <li>Added a line in the banner that says "in a real-time classroom."</li>
            <li>Took out the randomly generated school pictures background of the banner.</li>
            <li>Added a seperate section for featured school.</li>
            <li>Moved the search bar from the banner to an individual section.</li>
            <li>Added an area of recommendation tags to where the search bar was.</li>
            <li>Changed the original "View All Courses" bar at the bottom to "View More Courses."</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Why I did what I did:</h2>
        
    <p><span class="title">ONE</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;About one year ago, I signed up on Coursera for the first time. At the time, I was looking for interesting online courses to kill time.
    However, the original user model I had in mind was that all the course materials were already online and I should select which ones I wanted
    to self-study. Another classic element is the video lecture series that were recorded in a college classroom or an auditorium. I started looking
    for the videos, until I was asked to sign up for a particular course. That confused me. There was no signs of this sign-up process beforehand, or
    any signs of the different approach that Coursera was taking in the field of MOOC. It took me some thinking to finally understand how Coursera
    functions and what I should expect from Coursera. Therefore, I decided to alter the banner's text by adding "in a real-time classroom", which supposedly would be the first thing that
    users see when they open the page. <u>This means the message delivered by this text would be particularly impactful in users' perception and expectations, and
    the new line I added would strongly indicate that this is not simply a platform where you come and grab what you need.</u> Coursera is a place for creating life-like
    classroom experience, with classmates, assignments, deadlines, grades, and communication with the instructor.
    </p>
    
    <p><span class="title">TWO&THREE</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;For new users who are not clear on the nature of Coursera when they first open the home page, <u>they would
    be confused by the background picture of a random school.</u> Is this site a place for school recommendations? Is this site a marketing tool? To make the nature
    of Coursera as clear as possible, I took out the picture background and replaced it with the blue color that corresponds with the logo. However, <u>I still like the
    idea of having a different featured school every time an user visits,</u> so I added a seperate section on the right of the screen to showcase the featured school.</p>
    
     <p><span class="title">FOUR&FIVE</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, when a new user comes, or even an old user who does not have a particular goal in mind, he or she
     would need to stop and think for a bit before entering anything into the search bar under the banner text. <u>Asking them "What would you like to learn today?" is giving
     users a very big and general question to think.</u> There is a book on web design that is really called "Don't Make Me Think". Therefore, the search bar is replaced by recommendation
     tags. This approach would work more smoothly in that it helps give the new users an easy start with Coursera and the returning users something new and fresh. <u>I still
     kept the search bar in a noticeable place.</u> I also added the choice of searching by school because many users are actually more concerned with the source, and one
     big advantage of MOOC is that the mass population can gain access to the top universities that historically held resources exclusive for their own students.</p>
     
     <p><span class="title">SIX</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>The way the courses under the banner are laid out indicates that when hitting the bottom bar, there would be more courses
     streaming in.</u> However, that bar opens new tab that is a completely different layout, solely designed for the purpose of searching. Because there are only a few courses
     listed on the home page, there is a big chance that users would want to see more courses (this does not necessarily mean they want to see all of the courses) to find
     interesting topics. This is why I changed the text from "View All Courses" to "View More Courses", whichs would display another group of self-generated courses.</p>

        <p><span class="title">MAGGIE YUNJIE BI</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a sophomore at Cornell University, studying Computer Science, an enthusiast of graphic design, and a foodie
        with a passion for life. Web design has become my biggest interest ever since I found it to be one thing that could make me sit for eight hours straight without any thought of getting
        up to get food. User interface design, in particular, attracts me the most. It is an art that brings three fields that I am the most interested in together: graphic design,
        programming, and humanity.</p>
